# Weather PWA 🌦️

A modern Progressive Web App that provides accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts using ReactJS and the Open-Meteo API.

All visuals were custom-made in **Blender** and the application is built as a fully functional, installable weather dashboard.

## 📲 How to Install the PWA

This app can be installed on Chromium-based browsers only (Chrome, Edge, Brave...).

Click the install icon in your browser’s address bar **OR** open the app settings and click the **"Install"** button if available.

If you want to install this app on another browser, you can add it to the home screen. This is what I do with my Samsung internet browser.
